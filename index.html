<h2>SUMMARY </h2>
<p>My two greatest passions are connecting with people through shared experiences and laughter, and exploring the possibilities for human growth through technology. After practicing law and training lawyers to do legal research, I transitioned to performing standup comedy, and appeared on Showtime TV's "Louie Anderson Presents" in 2011. After that, I began booking my own shows for a wide variety of customers, becoming one of the top-ranked Minnesota comedians on both <a href="https://www.gigmasters.com/search/comedian-minneapolis-mn">Gigmasters.com</a> and <a href="https://www.gigsalad.com/Comedians-Emcees/Comedian/MN/Minneapolis">Gigsalad.com</a>. My customers' reviews reflect my desire to interact with audiences in creative ways. For the past ten years, I've studied Web programming on my own, with a goal to understand how to use technology to connect people and unleash our combined creative ability.</p>
